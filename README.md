## All of the Chef(x) content in one place. I think...

[Chef(x) Comics](www.instagram.com/chefofx) is my attempt to illustrate fundamental concepts in logic, creativity, and other topics. The Chef(x) is mathematician, the Red Chef is his evil twin, and the Sheep is a layman. 

[The Chef(x) Podcast](https://pinecast.com/feed/Chefofx) is a series where I have a conversation with a guest about mental health, jail, creativity, and/or science. The idea is to find the profound in the mundane through exploring the minds of others with unusual pasts. Sloppy philosophical conversations. Criminally insane stories. 

[Evans Cheffin Mixtapes](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1Ol8fuZMTCWVS1UNDJueEh1SE0) is a project I made while thinking about rebuilding my life. I share some of my enthusiasm for science while grappling with the new barriers I will have to overcome in order to participate in science. 

[Chef(x) Store](http://eee.etsy.com/shop) You already cook like the Chef(x), but now you can look like it! Bahaha! Check out the Chef hats, and contact me if you want to design one!

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/chefofx/chefofx.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/chefofx/chefofx.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
