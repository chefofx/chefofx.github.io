I've given a rough summary of each of my projects below. Click the highlighted [word](https://img.memesuper.com/0d2473e45db5e6cb52934ad3afafe0ed_img-word-meme_554-369.jpeg) to navigate to the content. Easy peasy. 

[Chef(x) Comics](https://www.instagram.com/chefofx/) is my attempt to illustrate concepts. They are abstract beyond comprehension at times, so feel free to ask me for an explanation. The Chef(x) character is a stick figure mathematician. [Sound familiar?](http://www.xkcd.com/) The Red Chef is his 'evil' twin, and the Sheep is a layman. Sometimes these characters are meant to reflect society as a whole, and other times, parts of myself. I will let you be the judge. Just know that I had a specific goal in mind when I made each of these brain babies. 

The Chef(x) Podcast is a series where I have a conversation with a guest about science, creativity, jail, and/or mental health. The idea is to find the profound in the mundane by exploring the minds of people with interesting or unusual pasts. Sloppy philosophical conversations. Criminally insane stories.
