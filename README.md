[Chef(x) Comics](https://www.instagram.com/chefofx/) is my attempt to illustrate concepts related to science or creativity. The Chef(x) character is a stick figure mathematician. Sound [familiar](http://www.xkcd.com/)? The Red Chef is his evil twin, and the Sheep is a layman. 

[The Chef(x) Podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-chef-x-podcast/id1227336978?mt=2) is a series where I have a conversation with a guest about mental health, jail, creativity, and/or science. The idea is to find the profound in the mundane by exploring the minds of people with interesting or unusual pasts. Sloppy philosophical conversations. Criminally insane stories.

- [Elmwood Recipes](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1Ol8fuZMTCWTGY1N29lakxuSnc) is a series of reality raps about psychosis and jail, written while I was incarcerated. Spent a lot of [time](https://img.clipartfox.com/d095b3a165fd9fe6183539b79ddb038b_batman-the-joker-is-in-jail-joker-hd-clipart-for-pc_1920-1080.jpeg) with these rhymes.  
- [Evans Cheffin](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1Ol8fuZMTCWVS1UNDJueEh1SE0) is a project written after my release which focuses on my thoughts about rebuilding my life. I share some of my enthusiasm for science while grappling with my inability to participate in science. Very [based.](http://i56.tinypic.com/w98i07.jpg)
- [Dishes4Days](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1Ol8fuZMTCWTnNjOUlsLS1Qdjg) is new material, with the same old story. Listen to the life of a young, criminally insane, chef mathematician. Extremely based. Dare I say dangerously based. I really need to stop rapping after this one and move on to projects of greater social value! I may have created a monster. Nikola Tesla on acid watching Cirque du Soleil. OOOooo!
