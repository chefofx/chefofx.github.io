I've given a rough summary of each of my projects below. Click the highlighted [word](https://img.memesuper.com/0d2473e45db5e6cb52934ad3afafe0ed_img-word-meme_554-369.jpeg) to navigate to the content. Easy peasy. 

[Chef(x) Comics](https://www.instagram.com/chefofx/) is my attempt to illustrate concepts related to science and creativity. The Chef(x) character is a stick figure mathematician. Sound [familiar](http://www.xkcd.com/)? The Red Chef is his evil twin, and the Sheep is a layman. 

The Chef(x) Podcast is a series where I have a conversation with a guest about science, creativity, jail, and/or mental health. The idea is to find the profound in the mundane by exploring the minds of people with interesting or unusual pasts. Sloppy philosophical conversations. Criminally insane stories. Listen on [itunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-chef-x-podcast/id1227336978?mt=2) or [google play](https://playmusic.app.goo.gl/?ibi=com.google.PlayMusic&isi=691797987&ius=googleplaymusic&link=https://play.google.com/music/m/I3rgybfbwoigom32k224js4y27a?t%3DThe_Chef(x)_Podcast%26pcampaignid%3DMKT-na-all-co-pr-mu-pod-16).

[Chef(x) Mixtapes](https://soundcloud.com/redchef): 
- Elmwood Recipes is a series of reality raps about psychosis and jail, written while I was incarcerated. Spent a lot of [time](https://img.clipartfox.com/d095b3a165fd9fe6183539b79ddb038b_batman-the-joker-is-in-jail-joker-hd-clipart-for-pc_1920-1080.jpeg) with these rhymes.  
- Evans Cheffin is a project written after my release which focuses on my thoughts about rebuilding my life. I share some of my enthusiasm for science while grappling with my inability to participate in science. Very [based.](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/093/172/THANK-YOU-BASED-GOD.jpg)
- Dishes4Days is new material, with the same old story. Listen to the life of a young, criminally insane, chef mathematician. Extremely based. Dare I say [dangerously based](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8u6EodZseg). I really need to stop rapping after this one and move on to projects of greater social value! I may have created a monster. Nikola Tesla on acid watching Cirque du Soleil. OOOooo!
