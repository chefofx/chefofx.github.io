I've given a rough summary of each of my projects below. 

**Chef(x) Comics (PG)** ([Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/chefofx/), [PDF](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1Ol8fuZMTCWZDNUX04zVmZLQ2s)) is my attempt to illustrate concepts. They are abstract beyond comprehension at times, so feel free to ask me for an explanation. The Chef(x) character is a stick figure mathematician. [Sound familiar?](http://www.xkcd.com/) The Red Chef is his 'evil' twin, and the Sheep is a layman. Sometimes these characters are meant to reflect society as a whole, and other times, parts of myself. I will let you be the judge. Just know that I had a specific goal in mind when I made each of these brain babies. 

~~The Chef(x) Podcast~~ **The Sheep(x) Yodcast (R)** is available on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-chef-x-podcast/id1227336978?mt=2) and [Google play](https://playmusic.app.goo.gl/?ibi=com.google.PlayMusic&isi=691797987&ius=googleplaymusic&link=https://play.google.com/music/m/I3rgybfbwoigom32k224js4y27a?t%3DThe_Chef(x)_Podcast%26pcampaignid%3DMKT-na-all-co-pr-mu-pod-16). In this series I have a conversation with a guest about science, creativity, jail, and/or mental health. (It's not limited to these topics, but they are the most common.) The idea is to find the profound in the mundane by exploring the minds of people with interesting or unusual pasts. Sloppy philosophical conversations. Criminally insane stories. [The Most Important ?'s in the Universe!](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1Ol8fuZMTCWWlVXc2dfLUZTdnM) (Meaningless questions.) [The Chef(x) Conjectures.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1Ol8fuZMTCWRHFEOXNZTl8xVUE) (Unsupported claims, which appear to be true.)
