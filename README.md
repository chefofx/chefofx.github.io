I've given a rough summary of each of my projects below. 

**Chef(x) Comics (PG)** ([Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/chefofx/), [PDF](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1Ol8fuZMTCWZDNUX04zVmZLQ2s)) is my attempt to illustrate concepts. The Chef(x) represents our drive to understand the universe. The Red Chef represents our drive to express ourselves through creating. The Sheep (or Sheep(x)) represents our ignorance. Shoutout [XKCD](http://www.xkcd.com/).

~~The Chef(x) Podcast~~ **The Sheep(x) Yodcast (R)** is available on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-chef-x-podcast/id1227336978?mt=2) and [Google Play](https://playmusic.app.goo.gl/?ibi=com.google.PlayMusic&isi=691797987&ius=googleplaymusic&link=https://play.google.com/music/m/I3rgybfbwoigom32k224js4y27a?t%3DThe_Chef(x)_Podcast%26pcampaignid%3DMKT-na-all-co-pr-mu-pod-16). I speak with a guest about science, creativity, jail, mental health or anything in hyperspace. The idea is to find the profound in the mundane by exploring the minds of people with interesting or unusual pasts. *Sloppy philosophical conversations. Criminally insane stories.* [The Most Important ?'s in the Universe!](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1Ol8fuZMTCWWlVXc2dfLUZTdnM) (Meaningless questions.) [The Chef(x) Conjectures.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1Ol8fuZMTCWRHFEOXNZTl8xVUE) (Unsupported claims, that seem to be true.)
