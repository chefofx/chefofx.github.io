I've given a rough summary of each of my projects below. Click the highlighted [word](https://img.memesuper.com/0d2473e45db5e6cb52934ad3afafe0ed_img-word-meme_554-369.jpeg) to navigate to the content. Easy peasy. 

[Chef(x) Comics](https://www.instagram.com/chefofx/) is my attempt to illustrate concepts. They are abstract beyond comprehension at times, so feel free to ask me for an explanation. The Chef(x) character is a stick figure mathematician. [Sound familiar?](http://www.xkcd.com/) The Red Chef is his 'evil' twin, and the Sheep is a layman. Sometimes these characters are meant to reflect society as a whole, and other times, parts of myself. I will let you be the judge. Just know that I had a specific goal in mind when I made each of these brain babies. 

The Chef(x) Podcast is available on [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-chef-x-podcast/id1227336978?mt=2) and [Google play](https://playmusic.app.goo.gl/?ibi=com.google.PlayMusic&isi=691797987&ius=googleplaymusic&link=https://play.google.com/music/m/I3rgybfbwoigom32k224js4y27a?t%3DThe_Chef(x)_Podcast%26pcampaignid%3DMKT-na-all-co-pr-mu-pod-16). In this series I have a conversation with a guest about science, creativity, jail, and/or mental health. The idea is to find the profound in the mundane by exploring the minds of people with interesting or unusual pasts. Sloppy philosophical conversations. Criminally insane stories. 

Visit the [Chef(x) blog](https://chefofxblog.wordpress.com/) for some essays inspired by, or vaguely connected to some of my other work.

Some selected songs from various [Chef(x) Mixtapes](https://soundcloud.com/redchef) are now available on SoundCloud! Reality raps, based freestyles, with a little somethin' soft for my science geeks. Nah mean?
